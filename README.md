*BountiX* is a decentralized bounty platform developed for the *Aptos protocol*, inspired by platforms like Bountycaster and Gib.work (prominent bounty platforms on Ethereum and Solana). It aims to connect bounty creators with individuals willing to work on various tasks, fostering collaboration in a decentralized manner.

### Key Features:
1. *Bounty Lifecycle*:
   - Tasks created as bounties are worked on as "builds."
   - Builds progress through the following stages:
     - *In Progress*
     - *Ready for Review*
     - *Completed*
     - *Cancelled*
   - Once a build is "Ready for Review," the bounty creator evaluates the work and can approve payment for successful submissions.

2. *Anti-Sybil Protection*:
   - Builders may be required to stake *APT (Aptos tokens)* to participate, discouraging spam and sybil attacks.

3. *Flexible Rewards*:
   - Supports *multiple winners*, allowing diverse contributions to be rewarded.

4. *Analytics Dashboard*:
   - An integrated analytics dashboard powered by a custom indexer provides insights into platform activity and performance.
